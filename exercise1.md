D is a programming language, made to be be a better alternative to C++. It has not succeeded in terms of popularity.  That could be partly because it's memory handling is using a garbage collector - making it unsuitable to system programming as well as for very performance focused games.  Anyway, it is a robust language with many nice features and a healthy, albeit small, developer community.

For linting and code analyzing there is a tool called D-Scanner. I have not used it, but I have used the D package and build manager, dub. I vastly prefer it to C's way of using libraries and (to me) hard to understand make files.  It help developers to set up the project with a pretty simple settings file where you can set library dependencies and build paremeters. Like npm with Node, dub can download depedencies and include them for the compiler and linker when building your project. You can set it up to produce several different compiles if needed, and, if you so wished, use different compilers (D has three excellent compilers) for your builds.

Testing is, to some extent, integrated into the language. It has, of course, asserts but also unittest, a keyword to create a unit test function.

GitHub Actions seems to be the first choice for cloud based CI-servers, definitely so if you are already using Github for your code repository. If you host your repository on GitLab, it's CI-service is a viable choice. Both offers some amount of free service. From the other options, CircleCI seemed worth checking out as it has a well defined free tier. There are many others, and most seem to offer at leat a bit of their services for free. Some services from the big players: Amazon has it's AWS CodePipeline, Google Cloud offers CI/CD tools, and Microsoft has, in addition to GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines. 

Jenkins seems to be the most common choice for self-hosting setups. Strider CD is another completely free option. Services with paid tiers offer also free versions: GitLab CI, mentioned above, offers also self-hosted software, and from the well known IDE-maker JetBrains there is TeamCIty.
